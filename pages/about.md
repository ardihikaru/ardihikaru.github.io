Hi readers! <br/>
I am **Muhammad Febrian Ardiansyah**, the owner of this page. <br/>
I am a **tech-knowledge hunger** and an **open source lover**! <br/>

My main goal with this article sharing is to help caring software developers and all tech enthusiastic people
achieve technical excellence and broaden their knowledge by sharing the best software engineering practices. <br/>

Here, I will cover topics as follows:
+ Practices of Extreme Programming
+ Clean Code and Architecture
+ Practices of Extreme Programming
+ Some practical examples or codes used by professionals

I do remember one slank sentence from the main character of [Price of Tenis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prince_of_Tennis)
where he always say, `Mada mada dane` (in Japan: `まだまだだね`), where it means that `you still have a lot more to work on`
or `it is not enough`. So, keep learning! :) <br/>

Oh yeah, one more thing, this web template is built by using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) 
and I use [Affiliates](https://bootstrapstarter.com/template-affiliates-bootstrap-jekyll/) theme.
My big thanks to them! <br/>
